Root hiding made simple, powerful when you need it. A [KernelSU](https://kernelsu.org) module and WebUI that turns SuSFS into clean config files and toggle switches for everyday use, with **strong hiding applied out of the box** via built-in spoofing and hiding scripts for one-tap protection, plus a script manager for power users who want more, all without leaving the WebUI.

> [!Important]
> **Future Direction**
>
> ReSuSFS will gradually move beyond SuSFS management. SuSFS will become optional, while development will focus more on UserHub, giving users greater freedom and control to create, manage, and automate their own scripts and configurations.

## Requirements

- [KernelSU](https://kernelsu.org)

## Install

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ahmed-alnassif/ReSuSFS/releases/latest)
2. Flash the zip in KernelSU Manager
3. Reboot
4. Strong hiding is applied automatically, no setup needed
5. Optional: edit config files, or use the WebUI to fine-tune

## Config files

All optional, all live under `/data/adb/ReSuSFS/`. Missing or empty files mean "nothing to apply" for that feature, no errors. Entries are appended in the order they appear, top line first.

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sus_paths.txt` | hide static/read-only paths |
| `sus_paths_loop.txt` | hide frequently changing paths |
| `sus_maps.txt` | hide mapped library files |
| `kstat_paths.txt` | spoof file stat for bind mounted paths |
| `open_redirect.txt` | redirect a path to another path |
| `uname.txt` | spoof kernel release/version |
| `cmdline_or_bootconfig.txt` | spoof `/proc/cmdline` or `/proc/bootconfig` |
| `config.txt` | toggle kernel flags (mount hiding, logging, avc spoofing) |
| `scripts/` | built-in scripts for spoofing and hiding |
| `scripts_postfs.txt` | scripts to run at post-fs-data stage |
| `scripts_bootcompleted.txt` | scripts to run at boot-completed stage |

## Built-in Scripts

Pre-made scripts for common spoofing and hiding tasks. They live in `/data/adb/ReSuSFS/scripts/` and are enabled by default for set-and-forget users. They can be disabled by removing their filenames from `scripts_postfs.txt` or `scripts_bootcompleted.txt`.

Strong hiding is applied out of the box with no configuration needed. Power users can fine-tune individual scripts via the WebUI or by editing the files directly.

| Script | Stage | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `ReSuSFS_apply-cmdline-bootconfig.sh` | post-fs-data | hides bootloader unlock state from kernel cmdline/bootconfig |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-kstat-add.sh` | post-fs-data | hides file stats for framework-managed paths |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-ksu-settings.sh` | post-fs-data | sets KernelSU features for hiding and compatibility |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-uname.sh` | post-fs-data | spoofs kernel version and build info from uname |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-mount-hiding.sh` | boot-completed | hides module mounts redirected to system paths |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-props.sh` | boot-completed | spoofs root indicators and removes custom ROM fingerprints |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-settings.sh` | boot-completed | spoofs developer options and debugging states in system settings |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-sus-maps.sh` | boot-completed | hides zygisk libraries and module font files from memory maps |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-sus-paths-loop.sh` | boot-completed | hides recovery traces, root tools, and suspicious pty nodes |
| `ReSuSFS_apply-sus-paths.sh` | boot-completed | hides custom ROM traces and addon.d paths |
| `ReSuSFS_cleanup-markers.sh` | boot-completed | removes susfs leftover markers from shared storage |

## WebUI Features

- **Strong hiding by default**, built-in scripts are pre-enabled for set-and-forget users
- **Status dashboard**, see if SuSFS is active at a glance, tap for the full enabled-features breakdown straight from the kernel
- **Configuration summary**, live entry counts per feature and enabled script count, right on the home page
- **Built-in code editor**, full-screen editor for every config file and user script, no terminal needed
- **File manager**, browse storage and load a custom file straight into any feature, without overwriting your default
- **User-friendly SuSFS configs**, every feature exposed as its own clean box: edit, apply, or load custom
- **Toggle switches**, flip kernel flags (mount hiding, logging, avc spoofing) without touching raw text
- **Built-in scripts manager**, view, enable, or disable pre-made spoofing and hiding scripts from the WebUI
- **UserHub**, create, edit, run, and delete your own shell scripts, with per-script toggles to run automatically at post-fs-data and/or boot-completed
- **Backup and restore**, export your whole config (and any UserHub scripts) into one archive, restore it on any device
- **Reboot button**, with confirmation, right in the header
- **Multi-language support**

## UserHub

A tab for managing your own shell scripts without a terminal:

- Create a new script from a blank template, or import an existing `.sh` file from storage
- Edit any script in the same full-screen code editor used for config files
- Run a script on demand, output streams live in the WebUI
- Toggle a script to run automatically at `post-fs-data` and/or `boot-completed`

Scripts live under `/data/adb/ReSuSFS/scripts/`. Which scripts run at which stage is tracked in `scripts_postfs.txt` and `scripts_bootcompleted.txt` under the same directory.

## CLI

Every command can be run manually via `ReSuSFS <flag>`. Useful for scripting, debugging, or if you just prefer terminal over WebUI.

Version: v2.3.0

[%] status: active ✅ | susfs v2.3.0 (GKI) | features: 9 🧩
usage:
 --action 				full apply (early+late stage)
 --stage-early 				post-fs-data stage only
 --stage-late 				boot-completed stage only
 --status 				show susfs version / variant / enabled features
 --status-report 			silently refresh module.prop's live status line

if [file] is given it is appended (deduped) into the default list, then applied:
 --apply-sus-paths [file] 		add_sus_path from list
 --apply-sus-paths-loop [file] 		add_sus_path_loop from list
 --apply-sus-maps [file] 		add_sus_map from list
 --apply-kstat-add [file] 		stage add_sus_kstat from list
 --apply-kstat-update [file] 		commit update_sus_kstat from list
 --apply-open-redirect [file] 		add_open_redirect from list
 --apply-uname [file] 			set_uname from config
 --apply-cmdline-bootconfig [file] 	set_cmdline_or_bootconfig from file
 --apply-toggles <early|late> [file] 	apply hide_sus_mnts/enable_log/avc_log_spoofing from config
 --run-script <file> 			run a user script from UserHub
 --run-postfs-scripts 			run all UserHub scripts flagged for post-fs-data
 --run-bootcompleted-scripts 		run all UserHub scripts flagged for boot-completed

 --help 				displays this message

```

Every `--apply-*` flag accepts an optional file path. Passing one appends that file's contents into the default config file (deduplicated, comments preserved), then applies the merged default. It does not run standalone or get discarded after, it becomes a permanent part of your saved config:

```sh
ReSuSFS --apply-sus-paths /sdcard/my_paths.txt
```

Check status any time to confirm SuSFS is active and see which kernel features are enabled:

```sh
ReSuSFS --status
```

## Backup and share your config

The WebUI can export all your config files, built-in scripts, and UserHub scripts into a single archive, and restore from one. This makes it easy to share a working setup with the community, hand someone your config, or back it up before flashing something risky. Your strong hiding setup travels with you.

Export creates an archive in `/storage/emulated/0/Download/`. Send that file to anyone, they load it with Restore, done.
